# Code review: Module 5

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. For each module, you will do a code review with one or more other students. Here, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

In order to keep the task within reasonable limits, for each module we will provide a number of aspects to consider for the review. These are also the aspects that your programs will be *primarily* graded on.

## What to do

1. For this module, you will assess and improve your code along just two criteria:

    - Style: can someone easily read your code and infer the underlying structure?
    - Design: is your solution well thought-out and elegant?

2. Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will review their code on the criteria above, and they will review your code.

## What to submit

Below, you will submit improved versions of your programs. These are only the "standard" editions of the problems, not the "hacker" editions.

In addition, you will need to submit a file called **changes.txt**:

- write down the names of one or more students who reviewed your code
- describe in detail what changes you made to the problems with respect to how you have submitted them earlier on

## Grading

After the code reviews, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for quality, and provide you with some written feedback.

Note that the mentor feedback will never be "everything" that can be improved, but a small sample. When you receive it, compare it to the ideas that you got during your own code review, and think how you could improve on your review next time.
